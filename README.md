## ðŸ“œ Kata Rules
* Build a very small game with gameplay similar to **Bricks & Balls**.
  
    * There are balls and there are bricks.
    * Each round you can fire the balls and control their direction.
    * The gameplay is encapsulated inside a rectangle the ball bounces off of.
    * When all balls reach the bottom, the round ends.
    * Hitting bricks with the balls increases your **score**.
    * There is finite gameplay.
 
* At the end of the gameplay there is a **leaderboard** with 100 players.
  
    * The scores of the opponents are not relevant - they can be random.
    * The userâ€™s score will be calculated as the number of bricks hit by balls and a **multiplier**.
    * The **multiplier** is set at the end of each game, **via a multiplier screen**.
    * The **multiplier screen** appears right before the leaderboard screen.
    * The playerâ€™s **position** in the leaderboard is **visually distinctive**.
 
* The **multiplier** screen has 3 buttons present: 1x, 3x, 5x.
  
    * The scores of the opponents are not relevant - they can be random.
    * The userâ€™s score will be calculated as the number of bricks hit by balls and a **multiplier**.
